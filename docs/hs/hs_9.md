## MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED

### üî¨ **Critical Issue Resolved**
**Problem**: System showed unacceptable accuracy for higher karat gold:
- **10K Gold**: $32.66 vs $36.42 target (89.7% accuracy)
- **24K Gold**: $73.44 vs $141.00 target (52.1% accuracy - completely unacceptable)

**Root Cause**: Using "one size fits all" weight calculation that ignored material density differences:
- **10K gold density**: ~11.65 g/cm¬≥ (41.7% pure)
- **24K gold density**: ~19.32 g/cm¬≥ (99.9% pure)
- **Density ratio**: 1.66x difference

### üéØ **Solution Implemented**
Replaced flawed reference scaling with proper material science:

**Old (Wrong) Approach**:
```python
# Used 10K reference and scaled by volume - WRONG
reference_weight = 0.75 DWT for 1.5mm √ó 1mm √ó 3 inches
calculated_weight = reference_weight * (new_area / reference_area)
```

**New (Correct) Approach**:
```python
# Use proper material science with karat-specific densities
volume_cm3_per_in = (width_mm * thickness_mm * 25.4) / 1000
g_per_in = volume_cm3_per_in * karat_specific_density
dwt_per_in = g_per_in / 1.55517384  # Exact DWT conversion
total_weight = dwt_per_in * length_inches
```

- White gold adjustments for palladium/nickel alloys
- Calibration framework for future empirical tuning
- Complete material science calculation methods

**Enhanced `core/pricing_engine.py`**:
- Replaced `_calculate_material_weight_dwt()` with proper physics-based calculation
- Added comprehensive logging for verification and debugging
- Material science conversion using exact constants:
  - 1 inch = 25.4 mm (exact)
  - 1 DWT = 1.55517384 grams (exact)

**Updated `models/pricing.py`**:
- Added `material_weight_dwt` field to BanglePrice
- Enhanced breakdown display to show weight calculation details
- Clear separation of price per DWT vs calculated weight

### Key Density Values Used
```python
STANDARD_DENSITIES = {
    '24K': 19.32,   # Pure gold
    '18K': 15.65,   # Average of jewelry alloys
    '14K': 13.3,    # Average of jewelry alloys
    '10K': 11.65,   # Average of jewelry alloys
    'Sterling Silver': 10.36
}
```
