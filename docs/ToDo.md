# Phase 2 Polish Tasks - COMPLETED ✅

All polish items have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Completed Items

### 1. ✅ Startup & Configuration Polish
- **Fixed Poetry deprecation warning**: Updated pyproject.toml to use `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`
- **Eliminated duplicate boot messages**: Implemented singleton pattern in SizingStockLookup to prevent multiple initializations
- **Fixed cache display**: Cache initialization now shows actual memory usage instead of 0.000MB
- **Improved date formatting**: Changed from "(date: 20250919)" to "(date: 2025-09-19)" format

### 2. ✅ User Experience Enhancements
- **Added "Back" navigation**: All prompt lists now include "← Back" option with full state-based navigation
- **Added Continuum Sterling Silver**: Inserted above Sterling Silver in metal options with proper SKU handling and quality skipping
- **Dynamic metal quality**: Replaced hardcoded 10K/14K/18K with dynamic options based on available SKUs from CSV data

### 3. ✅ Output & Readability Improvements
- **Cleaned console logging**: Modified logging configuration to only show technical logs in file, warnings/errors on console
- **Enhanced progress indicators**: Replaced generic "Calculating pricing..." messages with actual data:
  - Shows real circumference values (e.g., "Circumference: 68.24mm")
  - Displays actual material length needed (e.g., "Material length needed: 3.00 inches")
  - Shows found Stuller SKU (e.g., "Stuller SKU: SIZING STOCK:998425:P")
  - Displays real-time pricing per DWT (e.g., "Real-time pricing: $118.03 per DWT")
  - Shows final price calculation breakdown (e.g., "Final price: $354.09 + $475 = $829.09")
